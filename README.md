# WoW Vulpetter

Auto-pet your little Vulpera friends in WoW!

A WoW mod that will automatically /pet Vulpera when they are targetted. Will only /pet once every 10 seconds at a minimum to avoid being ridiculous.

*Note: Unit frame data changes in Midnight are probably going to break Vulpetter. I'm not sure many people actually have this thing installed, but if you do, know it's likely to break.
